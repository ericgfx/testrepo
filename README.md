# TestRepo

Here is where I can test my understanding of Git Hub.
In particular I want to test forking, pulling requests, so I should create a new github user for this.
As part I want to test timing and how it works with code writing, what happens to ten lines of code while one fork works on one line and another injects more lines.
Insert a fine line of text aqui.
And now to line 7.

Here is some text at line 9 (added from ericgfx with sublime)
#Here is one hash. Anything?

My hypothesis is that it will create resolve errors. Maybe the best thing to do is research the best way to resolve github sync errors.
I would hope that you'd be able to visually see the forks, but I also want to understand how it all happens within terminal.
Folders sure. But that'll get complex quick.

Well now isn't this fancy.
##Can't recall what 2 hashes do.
Only one way to find out. Viva la git.

And here is something that should save thanks to the nano editor modify buffer.
